    listAnswer:
    - There's a gunshot wound the side of the victim's head. This must be it.
    - The window of the car was broken. The bullet shot its way in through this window
    - The helicopter is hovering at the same height as the Ferris wheel cart. There
      are sketchy men in the other cart; but they can't be the shooter because it
      would've shattered the window of their cart.
    - The victim was killed by the gang members in the next car. The victim became
      too intimate with their boss's woman. This made the woman to believe her happiness
      with an ordinary man was a mere fantasy. She decided to live out her life by
      spending all of the boss's money.

    listAnswer:
    - The victim is wearing a jacket which says PARK RANGER; the uniform worn by none
      other than the park's employees.
    - There are keys attached to the man's belt. He must have opened the shed and
      brought it to the pond. But why would he do that after the park had closed?
    - A feminine glove is floating by the body. The victim is wearing gloves on both
      of his hands so this can't be his. And the design doesn't seem to match his
      taste... There may have been someone else with him.
    - A ring box is floating on the water. Turns out that the victim took his girlfriend
      out for a boat ride after the park closed. His girlfriend confessed that she
      had refused his marriage proposal which enraged him. In fear; she jumped off
      of the boat and swam away; not realizing that the boat had turned over. The
      victim couldn't swim so he drowned helplessly.

    listAnswer:
    - There's a knife stuck in the victim's chest which was visible even from afar.
      He called the police immediately.
    - Small boats are required to have vessel ID number displayed. Police tracked
      down its owner and began investigating on the owner's son as the suspect.
    - The bicycle by the lake belongs to the fisherman. In fact; some of his fishing
      gears are still on it. Since it would be difficult to bring the boat to the
      lake with that bicycle along with the fishing gears; police decided to rule
      him out as a suspect.
    - The barnacles covering the bottom of the boat suggest that the boat had been
      brought from seashore since barnacles don't live in freshwater. It turns out
      that the owner's son and the victim were colleagues. He murdered her when she
      rejected his love. He staged the scene by bringing in the boat; but alas; it
      didn't really help.
