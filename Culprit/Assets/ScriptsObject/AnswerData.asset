    listAnswer:
    - There's a gunshot wound the side of the victim's head. This must be it.
    - The window of the car was broken. The bullet shot its way in through this window
    - The helicopter is hovering at the same height as the Ferris wheel cart. There
      are sketchy men in the other cart; but they can't be the shooter because it
      would've shattered the window of their cart.
    - The victim was killed by the gang members in the next car. The victim became
      too intimate with their boss's woman. This made the woman to believe her happiness
      with an ordinary man was a mere fantasy. She decided to live out her life by
      spending all of the boss's money.

    listAnswer:
    - The victim is wearing a jacket which says PARK RANGER; the uniform worn by none
      other than the park's employees.
    - There are keys attached to the man's belt. He must have opened the shed and
      brought it to the pond. But why would he do that after the park had closed?
    - A feminine glove is floating by the body. The victim is wearing gloves on both
      of his hands so this can't be his. And the design doesn't seem to match his
      taste... There may have been someone else with him.
    - A ring box is floating on the water. Turns out that the victim took his girlfriend
      out for a boat ride after the park closed. His girlfriend confessed that she
      had refused his marriage proposal which enraged him. In fear; she jumped off
      of the boat and swam away; not realizing that the boat had turned over. The
      victim couldn't swim so he drowned helplessly.

    listAnswer:
    - There's a knife stuck in the victim's chest which was visible even from afar.
      He called the police immediately.
    - Small boats are required to have vessel ID number displayed. Police tracked
      down its owner and began investigating on the owner's son as the suspect.
    - The bicycle by the lake belongs to the fisherman. In fact; some of his fishing
      gears are still on it. Since it would be difficult to bring the boat to the
      lake with that bicycle along with the fishing gears; police decided to rule
      him out as a suspect.
    - The barnacles covering the bottom of the boat suggest that the boat had been
      brought from seashore since barnacles don't live in freshwater. It turns out
      that the owner's son and the victim were colleagues. He murdered her when she
      rejected his love. He staged the scene by bringing in the boat; but alas; it
      didn't really help.

    listAnswer:
    - A bicycle had just passed by the woman; but she's not looking at that direction.
      She is looking at the red car in front of her.
    - There was roadwork being held on the sidewalk. This also narrowed the space
      between pedestrians and vehicles; making it easier for the snatcher to take
      the woman's purse.
    - She remembered the license plate on the snatcher's car which helped police to
      narrow down their list of suspects to 2 which had same numbers for their cars
    - The snatcher had to be sitting on the right side to snatch the purse; so the
      answer is B. Further investigation revealed that B was a repeat offender in
      this area. Although he's rich enough to ride a nice car; he snatched purses
      to laugh at the look on his victims' faces.

    listAnswer:
    - There was a towel by the girl's side. Maybe the perpetrator used the same scarf
      to strangle the girl; choking the girl. On the girl's neck there was still a
      red band.
    - Letters B.O. are written on the sand. Police suspects that there may be at least
      2 culprits. One of which must have B in their name.
    - Without the periods; the letters on the sand would read BO meaning the murderer
      must have those two letters in their name. Bob is the only one that fits that
      condition. Police also found out that Bob and the victim had been in a relationship.
    - Bob was dating the victim and Beth at the same time. When the victim confronted
      him about it; He used a scarf to try to strangle his girlfriend. He tried justifying
      his action saying; I just wanted that girl to shut up. I didn't mean to kill
      her though.
